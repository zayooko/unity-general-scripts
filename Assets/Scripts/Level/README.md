# Editable Levels 
> with custom events optionals


## AddLevel.cs

  - Editable interval
  - Add event for each level up (option)
  - Add three special level goal events (optional)


## PanelLevel.cs
>Display level in canvas panel.

  - Editable "Level" text




### Notes
 Used OnTriggerExit & OnTriggerEnter, but this part could be improved and also add tags. 
 
 Maybe also add tags to canvas panels.
 
 Use TextMesh Pro because I think it works better in AR, but it should be indifferent to use this one or the normal canvas text.
